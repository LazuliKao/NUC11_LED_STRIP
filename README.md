# NUC11_LED_STRIP
Arduino Code to control the LED strip on the NUC 11 extreme

PLEASE Note: Once you program the Arduino on your NUC 11 extreme, you will lose the ability to revert back!

Instruction:
1- Install the Arduino IDE
2- Install the FastLED from the library manager
3- Compile and upload the led_strip.ino file

This project is by no means done and I am looking for your forks, hacks and contributions.
